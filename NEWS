Changes between 1.5 and 1.6:
----------------------------

Dictionary:
 * Internationalization of the dictionary binaries (compdic, listdic,
   regexpmain)
 * Support for a new dictionary format, with the following features:
    - handles up to 63 unicode letters (instead of 31 ASCII ones)
    - integrates the value and frequency of the letters
    - integrates whether letters are vowels and/or consonants
    - handles endianness properly
   The old format is still supported, but this may change in future versions.
 * Full Unicode support

Core:
 * Better Unicode support
 * (Technical) Homogeneous support for different types of moves
 * (Technical) Cleaner API
 * Several bug fixes

WxWidgets interface:
 * Accessibility improvements (shortcuts, more consistent menu, etc.)
 * Internationalization, with complete French translation

Ncurses interface:
 * Unicode support
 * New Bag display
 * Many improvements (smoother behaviour)

Note: like in version 1.5, loading a saved game in duplicate or free game mode
is known not to work.
