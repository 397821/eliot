Eliot is a Scrabble game.

It offers 3 different game modes (standard game, duplicate mode and training
mode).

The free game mode is the standard one, ideal for having fun with your friends
or family. You can play the game against a friend so that you can test your
skills.

In the duplicate mode, all the players are faced with the same board and
letters at the same time. It is mainly used in clubs and competitions since it
takes away the chance (and tactics) component(s) of the game.

The training mode allows to play alone and make progress for the duplicate.
It gives more freedom than the multiplayer modes.

Here are some key features of "Eliot":
 - very fast search, even with jokers
 - support of different dictionaries (French, English, Spanish, Catalan, Czech)
 - various dictionary tools (7+1, search by regular expressions, ...)
 - game variants: joker games and explosive games
 - configurable artificial intelligence
 - ability to navigate in the game history
 - saving/loading games

Enjoy!
