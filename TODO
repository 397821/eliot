TODO
====

 - unit tests for the navigation handling, in each mode
 - Improve error handling (use exceptions more)
 - Correct game save/load functions: Advanced format
   file saving for freegames and duplicate need a serious
   rewrite. We need to specify a file format that can handle
   all the information contained in a multiplayer game.
 - getopt support for all the interfaces (only ncurses is done)?
 - detection of blocked positions?
 - distinguish misplaced and incorrect words?

Implementation details
======================

 - game.h included in board.cpp!
 - board.h included in coord.cpp!
 - use Boost.Format?
 - compile with -ansi -pedantic by default?

Not so urgent
=============

 - add timers
 - network support
 - implement the dictionary as a GADDAG:
