* ====================
* TODO Current version
* ====================

 - Correct game handling : back() does not work                done 27/12/2005
 - Correct game save/load functions : Standard format          done 29/12/2005
 - Correc bag handling on setRackRandom                        done 30/12/2005
 - add a profile/performance test for Dic_search and Regexp    done 30/12/2005

 - The dictionary must use codes for performance reasons, 
   the board must also be made to use codes instead of tiles. 
   Using class Tiles during search results in a HUGE 
   performance penalty. Class cross is a performance killer. 
   Will return back to using code bitmaps in board for cross 
   search. Files cross.h and cross.cpp are to be removed or
   replaced by a 64 bits code bitmap.

 - Correct game save/load functions : Advanced format 
   file saving for freegames and duplicate need a serious
   rewrite. We need to specifie a file format that can handle
   all the information contained in a multiplayer game.

 - Add "joker" type games in wxwin version of Eliot, Freegame
   and Duplicate will follow

 - full French i18n interface and error messages for wxwin.
