* ==================
* Next Eliot version
* ==================

 - Improve error handling (use exceptions more)
 - Correct game save/load functions: Advanced format
   file saving for freegames and duplicate need a serious
   rewrite. We need to specify a file format that can handle
   all the information contained in a multiplayer game.
 - rack shuffling
 - new wxWidgets or QT interface
   - support of the different modes
   - ability to choose the number and type of the players
   - ability to display the history and score of all the players
     -- partly done: history is now a separate class
 - detection of blocked positions?
 - getopt support for all the interfaces (only ncurses is done)

* =============
* Not so urgent
* =============

 - network support
 - add timers
 - implement the dictionary as a GADDAG:
