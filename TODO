TODO
====

 - Improve error handling (use exceptions more)
 - Correct game save/load functions: Advanced format
   file saving for freegames and duplicate need a serious
   rewrite. We need to specify a file format that can handle
   all the information contained in a multiplayer game.
 - getopt support for all the interfaces (only ncurses is done)?
 - detection of blocked positions?
 - distinguish misplaced and incorrect words?
