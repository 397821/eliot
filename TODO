* ====================
* TODO Current version
* ====================

 - Correct game save/load functions : Advanced format
   file saving for freegames and duplicate need a serious
   rewrite. We need to specifie a file format that can handle
   all the information contained in a multiplayer game.

 - Add "joker" type games in wxwin version of Eliot, Freegame
   and Duplicate will follow

 - full French i18n interface and error messages for wxwin.


* ==================
* Next Eliot version
* ==================

 - new dictionnary format that includes tiles
   - number
   - points
   - printable equivalent
 - other languages support using the new dictionary
 - new wxWidgets interface
   - support of the different modes
   - ability to choose the number and type of the players
   - ability to display the history and score of all the players
     -- partly done : history is now a separate class
 - detection of blocked positions?
 - getopt support for all the interfaces (only ncurses is done)

* =============
* Not so urgent
* =============
