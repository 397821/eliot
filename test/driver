# Each regression scenario must be on one line, with the following syntax:
# scenario_name   rand_seed
#
# The rand seed is a number, used to initialize the random numbers generator.
# To each scenario 'scenario' correspond an input file 'scenario.input' and a
# reference file 'scenario.ref'. The regression gives the input file to the
# text interface (along with the rand seed), which generates a 'scenario.run'
# file. This file is then compared to the reference file, and if there is no
# difference the scenario is considered successful.
#
# Everything after a # is ignored.
